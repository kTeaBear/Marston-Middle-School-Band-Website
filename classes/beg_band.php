    <h2>Beginning Band</h2>
    <p>Beginning Band is open to all students who are interested in learning a 'band' instrument.
    A 'band' instrument is an instrument you would typically see in a marching band. Beginning
    Band starts with very basic instrumental instruction as students learn how to read music. The
    instruction will become more advanced as the year progresses. Individual technique is
    emphasized, as is playing together in a large group.  Beginning Band performs two concerts in
    the Marston auditorium twice yearly, once in December and once in June. If you have further
    questions, please contact Mr. Kent.
    </p>
	<p>A limited supply of instruments are available for Marston students to borrow for the years. Students are also encouraged to acquire an instrument as early as possible from local music stores.
