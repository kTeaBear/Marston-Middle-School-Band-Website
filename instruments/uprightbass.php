    <h2>Upright Bass</h2>
	<p>The upright bass (or double bass) is the largest member of the string family. As such, it plays the lowest notes, acting as the foundation for the rest of the band/orchestra.
    </p>
	<p>The upright bass stands on a floor peg and is played at an angle. Due to the height, players must usually stand while playing. Much like the violin, size is based on the student's height.  It is played using a bow or by plucking the strings.
    </p>
	<p>Because of its size, this is not the best choice for smaller students.
