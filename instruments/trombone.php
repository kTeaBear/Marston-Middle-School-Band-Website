    <h2>Trombone</h2>
	<p>The trombone has one of the larger mouthpieces in the brass family. This makes it easier for a player to create sound. It Is larger than a trumpet, making the sound more low pitched.
    </p>
	<p>The trombone is played by blowing into the instrument while buzzing your lips together. Varying the speed of air and moving the slider determine the note played.
    </p>
	<p>Assuming the student's right arm is long enough to move the slide out to maximum length, all ages should be able to play this instrument in middle school. If this is not the case, some players start out on trumpet, moving on once they have grown.
